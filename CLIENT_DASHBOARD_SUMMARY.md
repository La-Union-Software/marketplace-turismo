## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Navigation System**
```typescript

if (hasRole('client')) {
  baseItems.push(
    { name: 'Mis Reservas', href: '/bookings', icon: Calendar, roles: ['client'] },
    { name: 'Favoritos', href: '/favorites', icon: Heart, roles: ['client'] },
    { name: 'Mi Perfil', href: '/profile', icon: User, roles: ['client'] }
  );
}
```

### **Route Protection**
```typescript
// All client pages protected with RequireClient component
<RequireClient>
  <ComponentName />
</RequireClient>
```

### **Role-Based Content**
```typescript
// Dashboard content adapts based on user role
const isClient = hasRole('client');
const isPublisher = hasRole('publisher') || hasRole('superadmin');

// Show different content based on role
{isClient ? <ClientContent /> : <PublisherContent />}
